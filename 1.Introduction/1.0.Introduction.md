In recent years, most commercial firms are involving in Open Source Software. Not only as users of software, but also involving in as developers.
Different from some well known OSS project ran by enterprise such RedHat which is one of most famous distribution of Linux Operating System, many firms develop software for their own sake and distribute it as OSS for other developers in OSS community.

Bonaccorsi and Rossi in 2006[1] revealed that the motivation of commercial firm is mostly economical reasons. On the other hand many researchers found that motivation of individual developers are extrinsic motivation such as their career development, or intrinsic motivation such as reputation, enjoyment.
Firms hosting OSS projects are hoping other developers to help they develop new features or maintain code. It eventually help their success.
In OSS research field, there are many papers about what lead to OSS project success.
Stewart[2] and many other found License type choice is significantly related to project success. Technology use is also important to project success(Scacchi 2004[3]). There is another big stream of OSS research which takes OSS project development as a network and conduct quantitative analysis on network characteristics and project success.
Madey in 2002 figured out OSS development community is modeled as collaboration network.
Grewal find out network embeddedness has significantly positive effect on project success.

By searching many OSS research, it eventually revealed that there are a lot of research that show relationship of project success and other characteristics. But there are few research that how involvement by firms change OSS development and project success.

Our research objective is to figure out how firm's involvement change the OSS project as developer network. Specifically, figure out how firm's involvement change the network characteristics of the developers network and how it moderate the effect to project success.

And this paper suggest some theoretical implication and practical implication for firms which involving in OSS project on their own work.
