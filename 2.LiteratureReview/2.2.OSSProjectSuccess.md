## 2.2.1 OSS Project Success

FLOSS/OSS project success has been discussed in Software engineering field and Social Science field. As following papers did.

About OSS success itself.
- Nitin A, Urvashi R.(2006), Defining success for software projects: An exploratory revelation, International Journal of Project Management, 24(4), 358â€“370

- Kevin C, et al. (2006), Information Systems Success in Free and Open Source Software Development: Theory and Measures, Software Process Improvement and Practice, 11(2), 123-148

- Kevin C, et al. (2012), Free/Libre Open-Source Software Development: What We Know and What We Do Not Know, ACM Computing Surveys, 44(2), Article 7

- Subramaniam, C. (2009), Determinants of open source software project success: A longitudinal study, Decision Support Systems, (46) 576-585


And many others papers are focusing on OSS project characteristics and success relationship or pattern.

- K.J. Stewart, A.P. Ammeter, L.M. Maruping. (2006), Impacts of License Choice and Organizational Sponsorship on User Interest and Development Activity in Open Source Software, Information Systems Research 17(2), 126-144
K.J. Stewart, et al(2006) found the License choice has significant effect on OSS project success.


## 2.2.2 OSS Project as a Network

Open Source Software is modeled as social network of Developers and Projects.
There are also quite a few research from network analysis on OSS communication like mailing list, online forum.

- Madey, G.(2002), The Open Source Software Development Phenomenon: An analysis based on social network theory, American Conference on Information Systems

- Rajdeep, G(2006), Location, Location, Location: How Network Embeddedness Affects Project Success in Open Source Systems


- Signh, P.V., et al.(2011), Network Effects The Influence of Structural Social Capital on Open Source Project Success
