## 2.2.1 OSS Project Success
OSS success is one main topic in OSS research area which is about OSS success measures and how to assess project success.
### Success measures
In previous literature, several OSS project success measures have been proposed.
Based on OSS development and IS related field, Crowston, et al in 2006 proposed seven different OSS project success measures: system and information quality, user satisfaction, use, individual and organizational impacts, project output, process, and outcomes of project members[7]. Lee et al. in 2009 identified five different measures of OSS project success based on IS literature: software quality, use, user satisfaction, individual net benefits, community service quality. Subramaniam measured OSS project success by developer interest, user interest, program activity[15]. Some other researchers proposed to measure OSS success by measuring developers behavior. Luis et al. measured OSS success by developers loyalty[16].
These literature indicate that success measures are multidimensional. Grewal proposed intuitive measures of OSS project success, technical success assessed by CVS commits and commercial success which is assessed by number of download[17]. CVS is the indicator which shows how frequent the software is updated. Many researchers use CVS commits as project technical success and download as commercial success. In this research, we use number of cvs commits to measure project success.

### How to assess project success







<!--
OSS success measures and factors of OSS success are well researched by many researchers. Nitin A, et al figured out in their quantitative research that software professionals such as developers, project managers, customer account managers in any situation urgent, general, order of preference consider functionality is most important for software project success.[6]
Crowston, et al in 2006 suggested to use software quality, user satisfaction to  measure OSS success[8].

And many others papers are focusing on OSS project characteristics and success relationship or pattern.

K.J. Stewart, et al(2006) found the License choice has significant effect on OSS project success.


## 2.2.2 OSS Project as a Network

Open Source Software is modeled as social network of Developers and Projects.
There are also quite a few research from network analysis on OSS communication like mailing list, online forum.
